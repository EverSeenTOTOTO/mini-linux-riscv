# mini-linux

Minimal linux running on qemu-system-riscv64. This branch use [Arch Linux RISC-V](https://archriscv.felixc.at/), thanks for their great work!

## Tips:

1. Do **NOT** use `apt` to get riscv compiler toolchains, use <https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git>. The distro packages seem to be out-dated.
2. The root passwd is `sifive`.
